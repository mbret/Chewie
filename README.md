# chewie

Chewie is a home assistant.
The main goal of Chewie is to be completly open and act as a simple base for plugins. The system offer a backend that handle the plugin runtime and allow them to communicate and a web application to have control on it.

## Why another home assistant?

Well, at first it was a personal project started few time before all these home assistant where released. At that time I wanted to learn node.js and play with my raspberry. Then I rapidly took alot of fun developing it and decided to make a complete plateform based on plugins. My philosophy is to develop a solid base system which may be extended thanks to plugins and leave for a long time.
